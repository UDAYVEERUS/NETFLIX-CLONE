Also a few minutes of the Kremer/Grindenko/Schnittke /Sondeckis Tabula Rasa performance is shown which would lead one to think that there is a complete video recording of that as well as the WDR Radio recording used for the ECM release. The tone of the documentary alternates from serious interviews/work to humorous scenes of Pärt clowning around and German \"man on the street\" interviews with people being asked \"Who is Arvo Pärt?\". Overall, a fascinating view into Pärt's work and lifestyle. - Alan Teder",

The sudden arrival of Captain Johnson, whose small sailboat has been thrown off course by a storm, changes Jim’s life.  The Captain quickly becomes a mentor and friend to Jim, giving him extraordinary lessons in self-reliance and determination. Soon, Jim develops a liberating self-assurance that so deeply touches the Captain that he allows Jim to see evidence that the Captain may be more than meets the eye. Is Captain Johnson the same Charles Johnson who was a pirate there two hundred years ago?
